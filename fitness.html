      <h2>Fitness Tips</h2>
      <p>
        Staying active is an essential part of a balanced lifestyle. Whether
        you’re just beginning your fitness journey or looking to maintain
        momentum, the following tips can help you build strength, improve
        endurance, and support overall wellbeing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Warm up and cool down:</strong> Always start your workouts
          with light cardio and stretching to prepare your muscles, and finish
          with a cool down to aid recovery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mix cardio and strength:</strong> Combine aerobic exercises
          (like walking, running, or cycling) with strength training to build
          endurance and muscle tone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Listen to your body:</strong> Rest is just as important as
          activity. Incorporate rest days and pay attention to signs of
          overtraining.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay consistent:</strong> Short, regular sessions are often
          more effective than sporadic intense workouts. Aim for at least 150
          minutes of moderate exercise per week.
        </li>
      </ul>
