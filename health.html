      <h2>Health and Wellbeing</h2>
      <p>
        Maintaining good health involves more than just diet and exercise. A
        holistic approach addresses nutrition, sleep, hydration, and mental
        wellbeing. Here are some general guidelines to support a healthier
        lifestyle.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Eat a balanced diet:</strong> Focus on a variety of fruits,
          vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats to meet
          your nutritional needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the
          day. Hydration supports digestion, energy levels, and overall
          wellness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Get adequate sleep:</strong> Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep each
          night to allow your body to recover and function optimally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice mindfulness:</strong> Incorporate stress‑reducing
          techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to support
          mental health.
        </li>
      </ul>
